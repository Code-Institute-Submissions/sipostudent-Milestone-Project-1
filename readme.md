<h1>MILESTONE PROJECT ONE: HoneyGRUB</h1>

<h2>REQUIREMENT</h2>

Create a static (front-end only) website of around 4-5 pages for a music band, or your own project similar in scope to the provided brief. Moreover, a single scrolling page design can be utilised, so long as all page areas are clearly separated. After some consideration, I have opted to use a single scrolling page design for the purpose of creating a fictional information product and events website which specialises in honey items.

<h2>BRIEF</h2>

- Being as I have opted to create my own project, within the confines of the original brief. My intended audience would be honey enthusiasts who wish to use the site to hear audio information and view visual media.
- Use the site to showcase honey related content, such as recipes and publicise upcoming honey related event dates set by the fictional company/group as a means to network and share.
- According to the project requirement, the following assets should/are included on the website:
  - Photographs
  - Video media
  - Audio media
  - Links to social media, such as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, etc.

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>

The goal of this website was to provide a medium for users to navigate with ease, efficiently finding the information they require regarding the relevant theme, and to convince website visitors that they should become followers/customers of the service.

<h4>Initiating the Project</h4>

- market research to understand what websites of similar scope were already providing which provided me with a list of do's and don'ts to acknowledge and consider pre-production.
- pencil sketched all required content sections into a <i>'single page layout'</i> design.
- added dummy text content which was acquired with prior market research into individual sections, so to gauge product appearance.
- reviewed my sketched prototype with friends from professional backgrounds, such as marketing and design.

<h4>Single Page Application (SPA)</h4>

- In my opinion, Single Page Applications are better good for making responsive websites, supporting mobile devices, tablet & Desktop.

- No extra queries are required to the server to download pages; thus, the website loads faster.
- By opting for an SPA, I am able to provide better user friendliness via a simple linear experience, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

- The amount of content I have presented is not vast; thus, in order to maintain user attention, I opted to keep things dense as opposed to thinly dispersed or scattered across multiple separate pages.

<h2>DESIGN</h2>

<h4>Colour Scheme</h4>

- Honey was a core element in my website theme, so I chose to develop a bespoke colour scheme which would embody item this without clashing aesthetically. This entailed the following:

  - > #000000 color description: Black.
  - > #070500 color description: Very dark (mostly black) orange [Brown tone].
  - > #2e2300 color description: Very dark (mostly black) yellow [Olive tone].
  - > #fff2cb color description: Very pale yellow.
  - > #ffc107 color description: Vivid yellow.

  To generate my matching colour palettes, I used a colour encyclopaedia provided by ColorHexa.

OPACITY/TRANSPARENCY – property to add transparency to the background of an element

- Navigation-bar
- Float-to-top-arrow.

BOX-SHADOW CSS – property to add shadow effects around an element's frame

- Navigation-bar
- Buttons

LINEAR-GRADIENT – property to create an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colours along with a straight line

- Navigation-bar
- All major sections of the website

HOVER-CSS – to display pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device but does not necessarily activate it.

- Navigation-bar

<h4>Font</h4>

- Being as the website is based on a food product, I chose to apply a casual script typeface, intended for use in informal documents; thus, adding a comfortable tone to the displayed text content. The chosen font (Cursive) was applied throughout the website.

<h4>Navigation</h4>

- Fixed navigation makes it easier for users to browse the website and increase retention: In some ways, it's a passive call to action; always visible, always available. As a frequent website user, I get tired of scrolling vertically and feel the need to change. People like things which save them complication and time. Thus, by consistently maintaining a browser bar or menu anchored while users are scrolling avoids them having to scroll up to get to the bar when they want to browse other environments, sections, content and so on.

- Maintaining the logo visible increases the brand value: Today there are an enormous number of applications, many with identical or similar features, so I feel that it’s vital to make a good impact on users and retain their interest, which can be all linked to a good brand image supplied by a logo, the name and optional slogan line.

- By having a fixed navigation with an active hover which status highlights according to what section the user is currently positioned, e.g. 'home page' I can better ensure that users don't get lost and know where they are at all times.

<h4>Audio & Video Content</h4>

Being as this is a fictional company/group website, for the purpose of meeting academic requirements, I chose to include free for personal and commercial use media from findsounds.com which did not necessarily have an informative purpose to users, but would show the project accessor that I both understood and was capable of adding and utilising the correct code sequence/s in order to produce functional audio/video features on a website. Since controls on media players are an optional function, I chose not to add them; however, sound can be initiated by pressing an included CSS styled button; thus, meeting the project requirement.

<h4>Pictures</h4>

All pictures within the website are sourced from Pexels.com, free for personal and commercial use, no attribution required, and in alignment with the chosen theme of honey, which is consistently maintained throughout the website.

  - Galaxy Note 3 (simulated and real device)
  - Galaxy Note 9
  - Galaxy S5
  - Galaxy S9/S9+

* Laptops

  - MacBook Pro (simulated and real device)
  - Asus UX 305 (simulated and real device)

* Televisions
  - 1080p Full HD Television (simulated and real device).

- Website responsiveness was also tested by resizing the window with every addition of new code.

<h4>Tested Sections</h4>

- External links to social media websites.
- Internal links, which entailed those on the navbar to ensure anchors were referenced to the right sections.
- Forms for signup of newsletter and contact (although, form validation was not a requirement of this project).
- Checked button sizes so they were responsive and large enough to be clicked.
- Checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on multiple screen sizes.
- Ensuring individual section headers resized and appeared well when viewed on various screens and added opacity to the navigation bar to allow for more visibility of section header area on smaller devices.
- Spell checked all text content.
- HTML and CSS validation via w3.org.
- Checked margins and padding of the container (sections) to ensure the content within it didn't look disproportionate on various screen sizes, specifically smaller devices.
- Ensured the iframes were being responsive and displayed properly.

<h1>DEPLOYMENT</h1>

- Used GitHub Pages to deploy the final version (https://sipostudent.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/).
- All tests performed prior to deployment were redone on the deployed final version.

<h4>Identified Issues</h4>

- Once deployed, I realised that the images which I had used were uncompressed and quite large in size which took the total size of the website above 10mb which I considered too large for an SPA. So, I removed all images, compressed the file sizes, and then replaced into the website.
- The font-family which I used appeared fine within testing, but when I tested the application on a real mobile device or on other desktops than my own, the font-family would change. This issue remains unsolved and is pending resolve, but I am leaning towards the idea that the font I used is one which requires a purchase before it can be used in product/s for mass distribution.

<h4>Result</h4>

- With the exception of the font-family issue, I would suffice this was a successful deployment, all project requirements were met, and the website, although based on a fictional premise, has indeed proven to be functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.
