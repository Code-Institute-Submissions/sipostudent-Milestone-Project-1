# HoneyGRUB – Info Product and Events Website

Milestone Project One / User Centric Frontend Development / Code Institute

This is a fictional based information product and events website for honey produce enthusiasts. The website focuses on recipes using honey, honey nutrition values, video instructions cooking preparation, and finally, time, date, and location details for relevant events.

## UX

#### Goal

To provide a medium for users to navigate with ease, efficiently finding the information they require regarding the relevant theme; that being honey, and to convince website visitors that they should become followers/customers of the service.

#### Initiation

- Market research to understand what websites of similar scope were already providing which provided me with a list of do's and don'ts to acknowledge and consider pre-production.

#### Layout

- In my opinion, Single Page Applications (SPA) are better good for making responsive websites, supporting mobile devices, tablet & Desktop.

- No extra queries are required to the server to download pages; which consequently makes the website load faster.
- By opting for an SPA, better user-friendliness can be provided via a simple linear experience, with a clear beginning, middle, and end.

- The amount of website content on offer is not vast; so, in order to maintain user attention, opting to keep things dense as opposed to thinly dispersed or scattered across multiple separate pages seemed like a better choice.

#### Colour Scheme

- Honey is the core element of the project, so a bespoke colour scheme has been developed to embody the website theme without clashing aesthetically. This entailed the following:

  - > #000000 colour description: Black.
  - > #070500 color description: Very dark (mostly black) orange [Brown tone].
  - > #2e2300 color description: Very dark (mostly black) yellow [Olive tone].
  - > #fff2cb color description: Very pale yellow.
  - > #ffc107 color description: Vivid yellow.

  A colour encyclopaedia provided by [ColorHexa](https://www.colorhexa.com/ "ColorHexa Official Site") was used to generate matching colour palettes.

Opacity/Transparency – property to add transparency to the background of an element

- Navigation-bar
- Float-to-top-arrow.

Box-shadow CSS – property to add shadow effects around an element's frame

- Navigation-bar
- Buttons

Linear-gradient – property to create an image consisting of a progressive transition between two or more colours along with a straight line

- Navigation-bar
- All major sections of the website

Hover-CSS – to display pseudo-class matches when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device but does not necessarily activate it.

- Navigation-bar

#### Font

- Being as the website is based on a comfort food product a casual script typeface selection intended for use in informal documents was applied; thus, adding a comfortable tone to the displayed text content.

#### Navigation

- Fixed navigation makes it easier for users to browse the website and increase retention: In some ways, it's a passive call to action; always visible, always available. As a frequent website user, I get tired of scrolling vertically and feel the need to change. People like things which save them complication and time. So, by consistently maintaining a browser bar or menu anchored while users are scrolling avoids them having to scroll up to get to the bar when they want to browse other environments, sections, content and so on.

- Maintaining the logo visible increases the brand value: Today there are an enormous number of applications, many with identical or similar features, so I feel that it’s vital to make a good impact on users and retain their interest, which can be all linked to a good brand image supplied by a logo, the name and optional slogan line.

- By having a fixed navigation with an active hover which status highlights according to what section the user is currently positioned, e.g. 'home page' I can better ensure that users don't get lost and know where they are at all times.

#### Audio & Video Content

Being as this is a fictional company/group website, for the purpose of meeting academic requirements free for personal and commercial use media from [soundeffectsplus.com](https://www.soundeffectsplus.com/product/comical-bong-whistle-crash-01/ "Sound Effects + Official Site") was included. PLEASE NOTE, this material does not necessarily have an informative purpose to users but rather demonstrates a capability of being able to utilise the correct code sequence/s in order to produce functional audio/video features on a website. Since controls on media players are an optional function, they have not been added; however sound can be initiated by pressing an included CSS styled button; thus, meeting the project requirement. All video footage was sourced from [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube Official Site") (free for commercial use).

#### Pictures

All pictures within the website are sourced from [Pexels.com](https://www.w3.org/ "Pexels Official Site"), free for personal and commercial use, no attribution required, and in alignment with the chosen theme (honey), which is consistently maintained throughout the website.

## Technologies

- [HTML5](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/ "HTML5 Official Site")

  - Semantic markup language as the shell of the site.

- [CSS3](https://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ "Cascading Style Sheets Official Site")

  - Cascading Style Sheets as the design of the site.

- [JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript "JavaScript Official Site") (PLEASE NOTE: This addition was not a requirement and outside of the project requirement scope).

  - Used for open/close effect on the mobile navbar.

- [Bootstrap - v4.1.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/ "Bootstrap Official Site")

  - Utilised as the website core framework and consistent throughout

- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts Official Site")

  - 'Walter Turncoat', cursive and 'Schoolbell', cursive fonts were applied across the entire website

- [Font Awesome - v5.0.13](https://fontawesome.com/ "Fontawesome Official Site")

  - This was used for sourcing all utilised icons

#### Other Resources</h4>

## Features

Because the website utilises a ‘single-scrolling-page’ design, all code or content is contained within just one document (index.html).

- Bootstrap navigation bar/header – with a ‘fixed-tip’ so that it remains at the top of the page and can extend or collapse, depending on the screen size. PLEASE NOTE, Some additional out of project scope requirement code which utilises technologies external to HTML & CSS has been added for ‘Smooth Scrolling’ for sliding down the web page smoothly and ‘Scroll Spy’ that tracks certain elements and which element the user's screen is currently centred on.

- Contact forms – containing a set of questions to be filled out on the webpage by users that is automatically sent to the website owners’ email when it is filled out.

- HTML hyper Links – which refers to data that the user can directly follow either by clicking and which point to a whole document or to a specific element within a document. These can be found by clicking the specific text, such as that in the navigation bar, or clicking on specific icons (Fontawesome) like those in the events and home section of the website.

- Audio players – which is an embedded HTML sound element containing an audio source and can be triggered by pressing the relevant button marked “Play to learn more.”

- HTML5 video – for the purpose of playing video media. The website includes two videos which although not directly related to the purpose for which I intended, that is cooking tutorials, are aligned with the honey theme which I have maintained throughout the website. As stated previously, [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube Official Site") footage (free for commercial use) has been utilised for displaying competency in applying the correct code to generate functionality.

- Images – all emphasise the chosen website theme (honey) to keep cohesion within content whilst generating and maintaining user engagement.

- Social media icons – consist of [Facebook](https://facebook.com "Facebook Official Site"), [Twitter](http://twitter.com "Twitter Official Site"), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/ "YouTube Official Site"), Pinterest, and Instagram. PLEASE NOTE, because this is a fictional website, no other media away from the website exists; however, the icons each contain a hyperlink which when clicked navigate to the corresponding official pages of each social media domain. A GitHub icon has also been included which navigates to the account of the website creator (myself).

- Float-to-top icon – that takes users back to the top of long pages. PLEASE NOTE, this addition is outside of the project scope requirement of HTML & CSS only as it utilises jQuery for functionality.

### Features Left to Implement

- Image effects – to perhaps animate images and videos or have images enlarge to a larger size when selected by the user.

- Audio Controls – which are optional, and I have chosen to leave out could be added to increase the user’s ability to control more variables.

- Animated icons – for transitions to connect between two visual states.

## Testing

#### Key Points

- Both virtual and real device tests were run to test and access the functionality of the website and identify any potential errors. Furthermore, the application responsiveness was also tested by resizing the window with every addition of new code. Please see below a full list of devices used in the testing phase:

- Phones

  - Galaxy Note 3 (simulated and real device)
  - Galaxy Note 9
  - Galaxy S5
  - Galaxy S9/S9+
  - iPhone 5/SE
  - iPhone 6/7/8 (simulated and real device)
  - iPhone 6/7/8 Plus
  - iPhone X
  - LG Optimus L70
  - Microsoft Lumia 550
  - Microsoft Lumia 950
  - Nexus 5X
  - Nexus 6P
  - Nokia 8110 4G
  - Pixel 2
  - Pixel 2 XL

- Tablets
  - iPad (simulated and real device)
  - iPad Mini
  - iPad Pro (10.5-inch)
  - iPad Pro (12.9-inch) (simulated and real device)
  - Kindle Fire HDX

  - Nexus 7

* Laptops

  - MacBook Pro (simulated and real device)
  - Asus UX 305 (simulated and real device)

* Televisions
  - 1080p Full HD Television (simulated and real device)

- Website responsiveness was also tested by resizing the window with every addition of new code.

#### Tested Sections

- External links to social media and venue location websites.
- Internal links, which entailed those on the navbar to ensure anchors were referenced to the right sections.
- Forms for signup to newsletter and contact; however, it should be noted that form validation was not a requirement of this project.
- Checked button sizes so they were responsive and large enough to be clicked.
- Checked images to ensure they were responsive and displayed appropriately on multiple screen sizes.
- Ensuring individual section headers resized and appeared well when viewed on various device screens and added opacity to the navigation bar to allow for more visibility of section header area on smaller devices.
- Spell checked all text content.
- HTML and CSS validation via [w3.org](https://www.w3.org/ "W3C Official Site").
- Checked margins and padding of the container (sections) to ensure the content within it did not look disproportionate on various screen sizes, specifically smaller devices.
- Ensured the iframes were being responsive and displayed properly.

## Deployment

- Used GitHub Pages to deploy the final version (https://sipostudent.github.io/Milestone-Project-1/).
- All tests performed prior to deployment were redone on the deployed final version.

#### Identified Issues

- Once deployed, I realised that the images which I had used were uncompressed and quite large in size which took the total size of the website above 10mb which I considered too large for an SPA. So, I removed all images, compressed the file sizes, and then replaced into the website. This matter has now been resolved.

#### Result

- I would suffice this was a successful deployment, all project requirements were met, and the website, although based on a fictional premise, has indeed proven to be functional, user-friendly, and aesthetically pleasing.
